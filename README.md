## Description
This project is about creating a react app with a list of cocktails.The cocktails are listed alphabetically. This is done in ListCocktails component.

A user is able to search for the cocktail that they need either by the cocktail name or by the cocktail ingredients.The components responsible for this are SearchByName and SearchByIngredients components.

A user is also able to check the category of the cocktails and whether it is alcoholic or non-alcoholic. This is done by Filter and FilterAlcohol components respectively. 


## features
-Search Functionality:** Users can input search for cocktails by ingredients and cocktail name.
-Filtering Options:** Users can filter brewery based on category and alcoholic or non alcoholic.
-Listing of Cocktails alphabetically.
-Error Handling.

## Usage

-The user will be able to view the cocktails on the browser.
-The user will be able to search for cocktails either by name or the ingredients of the cocktails. 
-The user will be able to filter cocktails by category and whether it is alcoholic or non-alcoholic

## React Functionality

-useState-Manages state within dunctional components.
-useEffect allows data fetching from API.
-Components-are reusable pieces of code to perform specific functions.
## Technologies used
HTML:Markup language for structuring the web page.
CSS:Provides styling and responsiveness to the web page layout.
Github-Allows making of changes to the app by the group members.
React-used to build the yser interface

## Installation

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
